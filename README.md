J2 is a system that combines its three main components into something that can be viewed as



*   a programming language ("Edict", for "executable dictionary")
*   a C reflection system
*   a C library wrapper/"auto-cli"/"glue" system
*   a structured-data reader/manipulator/writer
*   all of these at once

Edict is a minimalist programming language that makes up for its simplicity by having the built-in ability to understand and dynamically bind with C libraries, providing "native" access to C types and methods of arbitrary complexity without writing wrappers. Alternatively, you can look at it as a reflection library for C programs that allows them to expose dynamic access to its own internals at runtime.

The language is built upon a foundation of three elements:



*   INFORMATION: All data (the entire state of the system) resides in a "Listree" structure, which is a recursively-defined hierarchical dictionary.
*   CONTEXT: J2 can curate type, function, and variable descriptions from C libraries via DWARF, including its own library.
*   INTENTION: A simple VM (with accompanying interpreters/jit-compilers) provides a unified method of accessing and exploiting instructions and data in the domain it's applied to.

These three elements assemble themselves at runtime into a multi-purpose programmable environment. The system bootstraps itself by:



*   importing its own library
*   compiling its VM kernel (by default, it defines and evaluates a REPL using imported C methods)
*   running the compiled kernel in the VM…
*   ...which in turn starts the REPL


## The Language

<Basics>

The evolution of the language has been influenced by Forth, Lisp, Joy, Factor, Tcl, Mathematica, and others.

Key Points:

*   The language runs within a simple virtual machine which evaluates bytecode.
*   The VM is stackless, it's bytecode evaluator does not recurse.
*   The VM manages storage for bytecode streams, it's data stack, the hierarchical dictionary, nested function calls, and exceptions.
*   All work is performed by implicitly pushing and pulling information on and off of the VM's data stack.
*   The fundamental unit of information in Edict is a "literal". Literals are just text, delineated by square brackets:

[This is a literal]

*   The Edict interpreter keeps track of nested square brackets, so:

[This is a [nested] literal]

is interpreted as a literal with the value "This is a [nested] literal".

*   A "\" character appearing in the definition of a literal "escapes" the next character, allowing the interpreter to create literals with (for instance) unbalanced square brackets:

[This is a literal containing a \[]

*   Literals are placed on the stack when declared.

## Examples

A simple reflective program:

    int! [3]@ square! stack!

Breakdown:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><code>int</code>
   </td>
   <td>Lookup and push value of "int" (a native C type) onto the stack
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>!</code>
   </td>
   <td>Evaluate top-of-stack, in this case allocate an instance of an "int"
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>[3]</code>
   </td>
   <td>Push the literal "3" onto the stack
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>@</code>
   </td>
   <td>Assignment; in this case, string "3" is automatically coerced into a C "int"
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>square</code>
   </td>
   <td>Lookup and push the value of "square" (a native C method) onto the stack
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>!</code>
   </td>
   <td>Evaluate top-of-stack, in this case an FFI call to native C method "square"
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>stack</code>
   </td>
   <td>Lookup and push the value of "stack" (a native C method) onto the stack
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>!</code>
   </td>
   <td>Evaluate top of stack...
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


You'll see int 0x9, i.e. 3 squared.

The explicit creation and assignment of a C integer is shown only for the example; a simpler version would be:

    [3] square! stack!

The same coercion would have been performed automatically during the marshalling of FFI arguments.

Note that "code" does not evaluate automatically; Evaluation is invoked _explicitly_ via "!". Code is just data until you decide to "run" it:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><code>[3] square stack!</code>
   </td>
   <td>data  and "code" on stack, unevaluated
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>! stack!</code>
   </td>
   <td>Evaluate TOS and observe results
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


Factorial:

    [@n int_iszero(n) 1 | int_mul(fact(int_dec(n)) n)]@fact


## Listree

In a Listree, a VALUE contains a dictionary of KEY/CLL pairs, where each CLL ("circularly-linked-list", implementing a double-ended queue) contains one or more references to VALUEs, each of which contains a dictionary of... And so on. The KEY/DEQ component of a listree is a BST implementation based on Arne Andersson's "simple" rbtree variation. (http://user.it.uu.se/~arnea/ps/simp.pdf)


## The VM

The VM is very simple; It evaluates bytecodes, each of which is an index into an array of C methods that implements the bytecode.

  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>CTX_POP
   </td>
   <td>Fuse top two layers of data stack, pop head of dictionary stack and push it to data stack
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>FUN_PUSH
   </td>
   <td>Pop top of data stack and push onto func stack, add layer to data stack, add a null layer to dictionary
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>FUN_EVAL
   </td>
   <td>Push {FUN_POP} to code stack, pop top of func stack and do "EVAL"
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>FUN_POP
   </td>
   <td>Fuse top two stack layers, discard null dictionary layer
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>THROW

</table>


*Exceptions are how both VM errors and conditionals are implemented, and they fiddle with the state of the VM a little more than the average operation, deserving their own paragraph.

This simple suite of operations is sufficient to interact with the dictionary, recursively evaluate language constructs (the VM is a stackless implementation), and most importantly, exploit C types, functions, and data. It is a bare-bones framework that relies on its tight coupling to C in order to extend its capabilities effortlessly. 


## Dependencies

(Any GNU/Linux distro worth its salt has these:



*   gcc, cmake
*   libdwarf, libdw, libelf (to read elf/dwarf debug section)
*   libdl (for dlopen, dlsym...)
*   libffi (foreign function calls to/from C libs)
*   libpthread (multithreading)
*   Optional: liblttng*/liburcu* (Linux Tracing Toolkit Next Gen)
*   Optional: rlwrap/libreadline (REPL convenience)

To run: Assuming gcc, cmake, and libraries are not too ancient, simply run "make" to build and get into the REPL.


## TODO



*   Symbolic ffi parameters
*   Do something with "comma" operator
*   Graph-preserving save/restore of listrees
*   XML, JSON, YAML, Swagger, lisp, mathematica-map bytecode compilers
*   Term-rewriting/symbolic-evaluation engine
*   Core libraries...
